To simulate the device location Camara compliant API, follow those steps:

1. Create a lambda function, give a name (i.e. Camara_API_External) select the latest python runtime and click on the "Create function" button
2. Upload the zip file that you find in the S3 bucket with name "s3://customer-agent-with-camara-api-${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/Camara_API_External.zip" 
 (where ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID is your AWS AccountId (i.e. s3://customer-agent-with-camara-api-12345678902/Camara_API_External.zip)
3. Click on "Add Trigger" and Select "API Gateway" as source. Select "Create a new API", select "REST API" and "Open" in the Security Section, and click on the "Add" button. 
4. Copy the API endpoint that you find in the Configuration tab of the lambda, under the trigger section (example of API end point format to copy "https://3kp0gyiq5d.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/default/Camara_API_External")

This end point must be inserted as environment variable in the "location-retrieval" lambda function, as "API_URL" variable 

    - Go to the "location-retrieval" lambda function in the AWS Lambda console
    - Go to Configuration Tab > Environment variables
    - Key = API_URL and Value = "the copied API endpoint"
    - Click on "Save Button‚Äù


NOTE: 
In the security section, we use the "Open" option for simplicity, however in a real environment the Camara compliant API is secured through proper autentication and authorization mechanism. Moreover as a general statement, never use the "Open" option of API Gateway in production environment.
